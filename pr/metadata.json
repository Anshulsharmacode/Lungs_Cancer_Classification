  "score": 0.9106,
  "approach": "Mathematical modeling using Computer Vision (CV-ML) ensemble approach with handcrafted features. This model extracts traditional image features (texture with GLCM and LBP, shape with HOG and edge detection, statistical moments, and frequency analysis with Fourier transform) from lung CT scans and combines multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, and KNN) in a voting ensemble.",
  "error": false,
  "error_message": null,
  "improvements": "1. Only 'normal' class was used due to naming inconsistencies between train and test directories\n2. For a complete model, resolve naming inconsistencies by creating symbolic links or renaming directories\n3. Expand the feature extraction with more advanced texture descriptors\n4. Implement gradient boosting models for better classification power\n5. Add more ensemble diversity with additional model types",
